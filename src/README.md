# Source Code

This directory contains all the source code modules for the Options Trading Bot. The code is organized into functional modules: `alpaca` for API communication, `bot` for main orchestration, `config` for configuration management, `logging` for structured logging with credential masking, `order` for order management with retry logic, `scheduler` for automated weekly execution, and `strategy` for calculating option spread parameters. Each module is self-contained with clear interfaces and comprehensive error handling.
