# Configuration Files

This directory contains the bot's configuration files. `config.example.json` is a template showing all available configuration options with example values. `config.json` is your actual configuration file (not committed to git) where you set trading parameters (symbols, strike offsets, spread width, contract quantity), execution schedule (day and time), expiration settings, Alpaca API credentials (using environment variable references), and logging preferences. Copy the example file and customize it for your trading strategy.
