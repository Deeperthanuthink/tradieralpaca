# Unit Tests

This directory contains comprehensive unit tests for all bot components. Each test file corresponds to a source module and tests core functionality, error handling, edge cases, and validation logic. Tests use mocking to isolate components and avoid external dependencies (no actual API calls). Run tests with `pytest` to verify all components work correctly. The test suite ensures code quality and catches regressions during development.
